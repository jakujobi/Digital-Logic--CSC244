# Moore Machine:
The Moore machine will progress through states based on the detected bits of the sequence '1010'.
The sequence detector will have five states:
- S0 – Initial state or any time the sequence breaks.
- S1 – Detected '1'.
- S2 – Detected '10'.
- S3 – Detected '101'.
- S4 – Detected '1010' (output Z will be high only in this state).
If a wrong bit is detected at any state, it will go back to S0.

# Mealy Machine:
The Mealy machine will progress similarly, but the output can be asserted as soon as the last '0' of '1010' is detected.
Therefore, it will have only four states:

- S0 – Initial state.
- S1 – Detected '1'.
- S2 – Detected '10'.
- S3 – Detected '101' (output Z will be high when in this state and detecting '0').
