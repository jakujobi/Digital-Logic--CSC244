3. System Verilog
In all labs (and projects) you should have exactly one SV module per .sv file.
The module should have well documented inputs, outputs, and internal logic connections using comments.
Use proper indentation using TAB to make your SV easier to read.
When connecting multiple modules together using structural SV, you must use explicit port mapping and not locational port mapping.
You will lose points if you do not use explicit port mapping.

4. Active Level Naming Conventions
Pick your variable names to mean something.
If a signal has a logic-1 when a door is open, name it something like doorOpen.
If a signal has a logic-0 when a window is closed, you might name it windowClosedL where the “L” indicates that this signal is “active-low,” or that it has the value of zero when asserted.
Obviously this signal could also be named windowOpen which would be active-high, but suppose the signal gave a zero when a fuel tank was full.
In that case a good name would be fuelTankFullL but fuelTankEmpty would not be a good way to avoid the active-low signal because “not all the way full” is different from “empty”.
It should be noted that there is no “H” on the end of active-high signal names.
Signal names are assumed to be active-high unless designated as active-low.
Also note that we should not try to avoid active-low signals, just label them appropriately.
There is nothing inherently bad about an active-low signal.
In fact, proper use of active-high and active-low signals can make the logic simpler or circuit faster.
